# Statistics
We can divide the statistics in 3 parts:
- Data analysis (Gathering, display and summary of the data).
- Probability (chance).
- Statistical inference (make conclusions base in Data analysis and Probability).

## Summary of the data.

### Mean
$$\sum_{i=1}^n\frac{x_i}{n}$$

### Median
Order all the elements by value, if is odd then get the one in the middle, if is even take the both in the middle and $$\frac{x_i + x_{i+1}}{2}$$
